Calculating the Required Fuel in Kilograms with Sukhnik Script
This section explains how to calculate the amount of fuel needed for a flight in kilograms using the Sukhnik script. The script takes the distance as an input parameter and allows the user to select the aircraft model from a pre-programmed menu. The fuel consumption per hour is already set based on the selected aircraft model.

### Usage Instructions

- **Step 1:** Run the Script with Distance Parameter
To begin, run the script with the distance parameter (in nautical miles) using the following command
```sh 
./sukhnik.sh -d <distance_in_nautic_miles>
```

For example:
```sh 
./sukhnik.sh -d 3400
```

- **Step 2:** Select Aircraft Model 
After entering the distance, the script will prompt you to select the aircraft model from a menu. Each aircraft model has a predefined fuel consumption rate (in gallons per hour).

The script will display a menu with available aircraft models. For example:

```markdown
Aircrafts menu
----------------------
1)C-130J-30 Military Aircraft
2)F-22 Raptor
[ weight_calculus@console ](Öƒ)>> 

```

### How does it work?
Below is the Bash script code with detailed explanations for calculating the required fuel in kilograms:

```sh 
function F_22_Raptor() {
	a=$(echo "scale=2; 0.38 * $distance_parameter" | bc)
	t=$(echo "scale=2; $a / 650" | bc)
	sleep 0.2
	echo -e "Time:${yellowColour}$t${endColour}${greenColour}hours${endColour}"
	b=$(echo "scale=2; $t * 6000 " | bc)
	w=$(echo "scale=2; $b / 0.48" | bc)
	sleep 0.2
	echo -e "Weight:${yellowColour}$w${endColour}${greenColour}Kg${endColour}"
	z=$(echo "scale=2; $w * 2" | bc)
	sleep 0.2
	echo -e "Total Oil Weight:${yellowColour}$z${endColour}${greenColour}Kg${endColour}"
	echo -e "${yellowColour}\n\t\033[5mGood Travel!\033[0m\n\t${endColour}"
}
```

#### Code Explanation
- **Aircraft Selection:** The select_aircraft function displays a menu of aircraft models. Based on the user's selection, it sets the hourly_consumption and fuel_density (the weight of fuel per gallon).
- **Fuel Calculation:** The calculate_fuel function calculates the flight time by dividing the distance by the cruise speed (which should be set based on the aircraft model, although it's not explicitly in the script snippet). It then calculates the necessary fuel in gallons and converts it to kilograms using the fuel density.
- **Script Execution:** The script checks if the -d parameter is provided and calls the calculate_fuel function with the distance as an argument. If no valid parameter is provided, it displays the correct usage and exits.

By following these steps and using the provided script, users can accurately calculate the amount of fuel needed for a flight in kilograms, based on the distance and selected aircraft model.
